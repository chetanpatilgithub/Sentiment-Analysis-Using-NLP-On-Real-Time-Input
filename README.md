# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP-On-Real-Time-Input
 In the project, the focus is on exatracting real-time data from user input query using web scraping, and performing sentiment analysis.The process begins with the user entering a query through a graphical user interface (GUI). The application then performs a Google search using the query and extracts the top search results, typically news articles, using web scraping. BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML content of the search results page and extract the article titles and links.
Once the articles are extracted, sentiment analysis is performed on the content of each article. The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library is used to analyze the sentiment of the text. The TextBlob library, a part of NLTK, is used to calculate the polarity score for each article. The polarity score represents the sentiment of the text, with positive values indicating positive sentiment, negative values indicating negative sentiment, and values close to zero indicating neutral sentiment. Further improvements in the project are sentiments are subclassified as sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, surprise.
